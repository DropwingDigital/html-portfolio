<h1>The Best Movies According to Tanika</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Alice in Wonderland/Alice Through the Looking Glass</h3>
<p>I grew up watching Tim Burton movies and seeing different renditions of Alice in Wonderland, so when I first saw these I knew I'd watch them more than once. I also went to see the second one in the cinema which was a great experience.</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Any movie by Studio Ghibli really, but this was the first one I watched and the atmosphere, plot and characters make it my favourite amongst them.</p>
<h3>The Transformers Movies</h3>
<p>Seeing them transform with more detail than the animated series made them memorable. The cgi was well done and the battles were good throughout all of them.</p>
